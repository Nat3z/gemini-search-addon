# Gemini AI Search

An addon for OpenGameInstaller that allows you to search the steam catalog using Gemini 2.5 Flash through Gemini CLI.

## Why?

I thought it would be cool to make an addon for OGI that uses Gemini CLI to run rudimentary AI inference. I mean- it's one of, if not, the easiest
AI system to setup, since instead of needing an API token and the hoops surrounding that, all you need is a Google account.

So- that inspiration led to this addon. It's a proof-of-concept, mostly.

## How to Install

Go to OpenGameInstaller's Community Addons Tab and select the Gemini AI Search addon in the list.

You can use this addon and its code however you want. I don't really care.
